Firewii is a fullscreen fire animation demo for Wii based on ideas taken from Asphyxia ASM tutorial #19, which was written by Denthor a long long time ago.

As the 1996 original code, it has some hypnotic beauty inside that makes everybody to stay looking at flames. So it is great if you want to have a special moment full of relax and charm. It is always nice to sit on a carpet near of the warm fire in the living room ;)

I began to write it as a performance test for the plot and line functions of GRRLIB 4.1.
